Worst vacation ever." />

Use brings about wear, tear, and rust â€” and that's a real waste." />
      <LINE text="Why I never went to the Dungeon myself? Because I'm on a vacation, that's why. Besides, I have my own damn problems in the City: drugs, organized crime and meager salaries." />
      <LINE text="No, I don't know Claire. I was surprised myself, when I learned that she is a Soldier as well. And on a vacation too! What a silly coincedence..." />

I wonder what changed him..." />

Oh, wait, that's not my line...

Yeah, I used to say that. :-)" />

&quot;The Dungeon&quot;." />
	    <LINE text="No one knows why evil appeared in the Dungeon. People say that there's been some iniquity down there, a miner was killed in a dispute... And now he is seeking revenge on us for abandoning him. Scary!" />

Redstone is red and this is all true!" />

Look who's talking!" />
	    <LINE text="Business has been pretty much frozen since these events started. I'm thinking of going to the City for earnings. I wonder why they never bothered to send some guards or soldiers or someone here to look into our situation." />
